                <h4>Animation is the art of presenting still photographs with the help of various computer-based techniques in a
                    Manner which gives an impression to the viewer that it is running like a film. It could be a mixed version of multimedia
                    Text, graphic art, sound, animation and video sourced through computer or some other electronic media. Multimedia
                    Has become an inevitable part of any presentation. It has found a variety of applications right from entertainment to
                    Education.

                <h4>
                    Graphic design focuses on communicating a message visually. The message may be to provide information,
                    invoke thought, sell a product or even stimulate meaningful conversation. Graphic design is all around you. It’s about
                    expressing an idea in the best way using visual story telling. This may sound simple, but it requires problem solving,
                    communication, attentiveness, patience, and most importantly a good grasp of the project’s desired result.
                    The popularization of social media and the advancements in technology have sparked curiosity about graphic
                    design. The ability to easily share information is leading to an increasing number of artists looking to share their work
                    and engage with new audiences. Technology provides opportunities for the most novice of art lovers to share their
                    artwork.

                    Copyright infringement happens whenever someone makes copies or
                    commercially exploits a work without the copyright owner's permission. The
                    second work must actually be copied from the first work—if you just happen
                    to create a very similar work independently, that is not infringement. The
                    problems arise when one artist uses another artist's work as reference. To be
                    infringing, the second artist's works need not be identical.
